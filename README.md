ASSIGNMENT 5 Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python

  ----------
  Overview
  ----------

This assignment focuses on understanding and implementing basic data
structures and string handling concepts in Python. The tasks included in
this module demonstrate the use of dictionaries and lists, which are
essential components of Python programming.

The assignment consists of two tasks:

Task 1: Creating and working with a dictionary to store student marks.

Task 2: Using list slicing techniques to extract and manipulate data.

  Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
  ----------------------------------------------

Objective:

The purpose of this task is to understand how dictionaries work in
Python and how they can be used to store and retrieve data efficiently.

Description:

In this task, a program is created that stores student names as keys and
their corresponding marks as values in a dictionary. The program allows
the user to enter the name of a student and then searches the dictionary
to find the marks associated with that student.

If the student name exists in the dictionary, the program displays the
corresponding marks.

If the student name is not present in the dictionary, the program
displays an appropriate message indicating that the student record was
not found.

Expected Behavior:

When a valid student name is entered, the program should display the
marks of that student.

When an invalid or unknown student name is entered, the program should
display a message indicating that the student was not found.

  ----------------------------------
  Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing
  ----------------------------------

Objective:

The purpose of this task is to understand how list slicing works in
Python and how lists can be manipulated efficiently.

Description:

In this task, a list containing numbers from 1 to 10 is created. Using
list slicing techniques, the first five elements of the list are
extracted.

After extracting the first five elements, the extracted list is
reversed.

Both the extracted list and the reversed list are then displayed as
output.


Expected Behavior:

The program should successfully create a list of numbers from 1 to 10.

It should extract the first five elements from the list.

It should reverse the extracted elements.

Finally, it should display both: - The extracted list - The reversed
list
